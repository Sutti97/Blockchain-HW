## What Is It:
* HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. operates as a cryptocurrency mining company in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland. It involves the mining and sale of digital currencies, such as Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin. HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. was incorporated in 1987 and is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. The company was originally  known as Leeta Gold Corp. and changed its name to HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. in September 2017. The Company validates transactions on block chain networks, as well as provides crypto mining and builds bridges between crypto and traditional capital markets. HIVE Blockchain Technologies serves customers worldwide.

* Hive validates transactions on blockchain networks such as Ethereum for rewards paid in cryptocurrencies. Everyday HIVE earns new crypto coins which it can monetize for revenue and cash flow. The biggest costs incurred during mining of cryptocurrencies are electricity costs, hardware and fast internet. That is why they owns state-of-the-art green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden and Iceland and are therfore able toenjoy the low cost green/renewable energy and stable governments. Hive follows the below formula to operate business and generate profits:


## Why This Matters:

* HIVE Blockchain Technologies is the first publicly traded crypto miner, listing on the Toronto Venture Exchange in 2017, under the ticker symbol HIVE. The company uses 100% green energy to mine both Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a committed ESG strategy since day one. Companies provide cloud mining services to customers who lease mining capacity for a fixed period of time to mine their own coins. This is significantly different from HIVE, which directly operates its facilities and is itself a business operator. As a publicly traded company, HIVE provides shareholders with exposure to the margins of mining, together with the price performance of a portfolio of crypto coins held and managed by HIVE. Leasing hash is finite and non-transferrable. This is the main distinction from HIVE.

## Why This May be Interesting:

# First Mover Advantage
* First publicly listed blockchain infrastructure company that bridges blockchain and cryptocurrencies to traditional capital markets

* Providing a pure play blockchain investment for the capital markets while creating long term shareholder value

# Low Cost Operator

* Low working capital requirements does not require immediate sale of mined coins and allows HIVE to strategically sell coins to maximize profit

* Operations situated in cool and politically stable jurisdictions (Canada, Sweden & Iceland) with access to low cost green/renewable energy
